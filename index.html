      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a student at Illinois Tech. I am currently a second year
        undergraduate student in the ITM major program. I am from Chicago. I
        attended Solorio Academy High School before choosing to come to Illinois
        Tech. I have always been into technology. The reason I decided to get
        into the ITM major was because ITM is pretty much programming and a bit
        of hardware. I am always eager to learn what technology can do to make
        everyday life more efficient.

      <h3>Things I do in my free time:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p id="freetime">Gaming</p>
          <p>
            I usually take time to enjoy either game myself or just watch other
            people stream on twitch and youtube. I am into pretty much any genre
            of game. I am currently playing a lot of 2k. I can't wait until Cold
            War is released cause i've been waiting to get my hands on a COD
            with some zombies. I game on playstation under the name
            "OneGenesis-". Feel free to add me if your'e a gamer as well.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p id="freetime">Work on cars</p>
          <p>
            As you will probably find out from my site in the hobbies page, I am
            into cars. Cars have been in my life since I was young. My uncle
            would be working on his own car and now he is a mechanic. He has
            taught me a lot of what I know about cars. That is probably the main
            reason I like to work on cars.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p id="freetime">Spend time with family</p>
          <p>
            I come from a family of 5. My mother is a stay at home mom while my
            father works as a laborer. I have an older sister that is currently
            in her 3rd year of college at uic. My other sibling is my younger
            brother and he is a 1st year at uic. Most times we hang out and
            watch a movie together and just relax and try to get along the best
            way we can.
